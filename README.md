Title:
Heart Disease Risk Prediction Using Linear Regression

Description:
This project predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on two key features: biking and smoking habits. Using linear regression, the model calculates the percentage risk of heart disease for individuals. The trained model is serialized with Pickle and integrated into a user-friendly application built in Spyder IDE. The application runs on a local server, allowing users to input their biking and smoking data to receive a real-time risk prediction.

Objective:
Use linear regression to predict heart disease risk percentage based on biking and smoking data.
Build a trained predictive model and serialize it using Pickle for seamless integration.
Create a local web application to provide users with an intuitive interface for entering data and viewing predictions.
Deploy the application locally to demonstrate the functionality of the predictive model.
